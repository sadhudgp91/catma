# catma
Tagger output files for annotation purpose

Introduction
CATMA is a web based application for text annotation and analysis.

It has two main components: an annotation component that allows the user to annotate text and an analysis component that supports pattern analysis of text and annotations in combination through a custom but easy query language and a data visualization facility based on Vega.

It also allows the project-centric management of text corpora, annotation collections, tagsets and team members.

CATMA uses a Gitlab instance as its backend to store and manage the project's resources and team. All resources are versioned and available through either the CATMA web interface or the Gitlab REST API.
